            <h1>What is art gallery </h1>
            <p>An art gallery is a room or a building in which visual art is displayed. In Western cultures from the
                mid-15th century, a gallery was any long, narrow covered passage along a wall, first used in the sense
                of a
                place for art in the 1590s. The long gallery in Elizabethan and Jacobean houses served many purposes
                including the display of art. Historically, art is displayed as evidence of status and wealth, and for
                religious art as objects of ritual or the depiction of narratives. </p>
            <p>The first galleries were in the palaces of the aristocracy, or in churches. As art collections grew,
                buildings became dedicated to art, becoming the first art museums.

                Among the modern reasons art may be displayed are aesthetic enjoyment, education, historic preservation,
                or
                for marketing purposes.</p>

            <h2>Sketching </h2>
            <p>Sketching is a fundamental artistic technique that involves the creation of quick, informal, and
                simplified
                drawings to capture the essence, form, and structure of a subject or idea. <br>The key characteristics
                of
                sketching are:<br>
                Prioritizes expression of ideas and emotions over realism and detail<br>
                Focuses on essential elements like shape, proportion, and movement to convey the underlying structure
                and
                rhythm<br>
                Can take many forms, from simple line drawings to more refined renderings<br>
                Serves as a visual language for artists to explore, communicate, and refine their thoughts and
                concepts<br>
                Useful for a wide range of activities, both artistic and non-artistic, such as fine art, illustration,
                graphic design, architecture, and product design
                Often done quickly using various media like pencils, pens, charcoal, pastels, and digital tools<br>
                Allows for experimentation, idea generation, and practicing technique<br>
                Can capture the essence, mood, and impression of a subject or scene<br></p>
